         Seeing I: The Other, as part of the European Media Arts Residency Exchange 
      </h3>
      <div class="intro-top">
         <p>Culminating an online residency with the the European Media Art Platforms program at Werkleitz, as part of the Creative Europe Culture Programme of the European Union, we are streaming the lives of three migrants from around the world, in first person point of view.</p>
         <p>Focusing on real-life lives that are neither sensational, nor a spectacle, Seeing I: The Other explores the movement of people in 2020; how different cultures, societies, and languages affects one’s sense of self, and - especially during the coronavirus pandemic - the ability to share in one’s experience and world, only through digital technologies.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="intro-bottom">
         <p>Without too much interference to their daily routine, we have asked people to:</p>
         <p>⁃	Wear the pair of glasses/recorder from the moment they wake up, to the moment they go to sleep. </p>
         <p>⁃	To not remove the recorder, or switch the recorder off for the entirety of that day, unless they feel unsafe.</p>
         <p>⁃	We have specifically ask people to be sociable, and to not use their phone or computer as much as possible.</p>
         <p>⁃	Curate their day slightly, focusing on their experience as a migrant, and any political issues that are personal to them.</p>
