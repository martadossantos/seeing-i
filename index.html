   <section class="introduction">
      <p>Seeing I, late 2021: For 24-hours a day, for 14-days, artist Mark Farid will wear a virtual reality headset, experiencing life through the eyes and ears of one person; hearing only what they hear and seeing only what they see for two weeks.</p>
      <p>Inspired by Psychologist Philip Zimbardo’s ‘Stanford Prison Experiment’ (1971), Philosopher Jean Baudrillard’s ‘Simulacra and Simulation’ (1981), and Artist Josh Harris’ ‘Quiet: We Live in Public’ (1999), Seeing I will confine Farid to a gallery space, subject to the simulated life of the project’s Other. With no existing relationship to the Other, how will the constant stream of artificial sights and sounds start to displace Farid’s own internal monologue? For the duration of the project, Farid will experience no human interaction relative to his own life, allowing his indirect relationship with the Other to become his leading narrative.</p>
      <p>Adapting the question of nature vs. nurture to the digital age, Seeing I will consider how large a portion of the individual is an inherent self, and how large a portion is a consequence of environment and culture. How will the 14-days alter Farid’s movement, mannerisms, personality, and most importantly, his rationale? Without free will to determine and shape who he is, will Farid’s consciousness be enough to deter significant change?</p>
      <p>Seeing I was conceived and created by artist Mark Farid, is commissioned by arebyte Gallery, UK, and the European Media Art Platforms EMARE program at Wekleitz with the support of the Creative Europe Culture Programme of the European Union, and supported by tthe National Theatre Immersive Storytelling Studio, UK, Body<Data>Space, UK, and the Sundance Institute, USA.</p>

               <p>The gallery space will contain all necessary facilities for the course of the 14-days: a double bed, bathroom, exercise bike, and a table and chair. This space will be open for audiences to visit onsite and online.</p>

This will enable Farid to independently navigate his way around the room to the bed, bathroom and exercise bike.</p>

               <p>We take for granted that the 21st Century is domesticated. Mechanically and physically, our audio-sensory experiences have been engineered; from the creak of a floorboard, to church-bells ringing, to an engine revving. We look out of our windows and see square gardens; beyond our hedges, humans have built every building, road, park and field. None exist without man.</p>
               <p>We comprehend and shape the world in our own, distinct image - an image formed by environmental, cultural and genetic factors. To alter these variables subsequently reshape the individual, and how they comprehend the world. Just as humans’ impact on the environment adjusts the weather, we have grown accustomed to an artificial reality, cultivated and curated to the needs of man.</p>
               <p>Our sensations and awareness of our surroundings are substituted by a fictional simulation; having known nothing else, we believe this fiction to be truth. At this point, simulation becomes life. Assuming that the physical world is the 'real' world, we submerse and surrender ourselves to manufactured sensory input; standing in Plato’s cave, facing the walls and naming shadows, oblivious to the fire outside.</p>

            <p>“Seeing I documents an extraordinary social psychology single-case study, an experiment in which for one month Mark sees the world only through other people's eyes. All this is possible through new technology. One might imagine various outcomes of this experiment: that he might become more empathic, being other- rather than self-focused; that he might experience distorted perceptions and even delusions, given that his own brain is not receiving its normal input but instead is experiencing a kind of sensory deprivation; or that he might establish that the brain can in fact adapt relatively quickly (hours or days?) to a new reality, and then adapt back again at the end of the experiment, with no serious side-effects."</p>

            <p>“The point is to discover how adaptable the brain is to another physical body – and whether our sense of self comes from inherent personality or cultural identity.

            <p>“One of many aspects of this project that really interests me, is the connection between the reality which is being experienced by Mark and the Other. If I was able to create an identical situation for Mark within the Gallery: temperature, touch, smell, it would be a bad piece of work, because what is happening is exactly linear. What we call Mark right now, is trying to find itself, and this is exactly between the real space and time we are in; everything else is projected into his mind. This must be in collision, and once it is, then we will have something very interesting. Here, as an image and as a situation, any attempt to put Mark into the exact situation where temperature, smell, touch etc. are the same as the Other’s, makes this a boring scientific experiment, but where it becomes Art, is because of the creation of this friction and discontinuity."</p>

            <p>“Even though Mark will be viewing video through VR goggles, this is still a form of sensory deprivation, the duration and intensity reminiscent of the CIA's astonishingly unethical MK ULTRA experiments.  They'd take volunteers, remove stimulus (placing goggles on them that diffused light and headphones that played constant low noise) and confine them for extended periods of time to observe the psychological impact.</p>
            <p>What was discovered was that after prolonged periods of sensory deprivation the subjects would become overly vulnerable to any stimulation. They would find themselves in agreement with whatever they were told, even if they were ideas that they'd have automatically dismissed as ridiculous prior to the experiment."</p>

            <p>“This isn’t escapism. Farid is not trying to live as a famous actor, or a star athlete. For the duration of the exhibition, all Farid will experience will be video and audio captured by a complete stranger, going about their daily life. When they eat, he’ll eat. When they sleep, he’ll sleep. As much as modern technology permits, he will let his individual identity evaporate."</p>

            <p>“My initial thoughts are that it is an extremely interesting project and raises a number of important topical issues about society and our human interactions with technology. It also raises ethical issues, including of personhood and what the effects of reality distortion are on the brain and psychological processes. However, I am concerned about how such a long project which involves voyeurism on the part of Mark and also on the part of the public in regard to Mark will affect his mental health and wellbeing. It could be extremely disturbing and it is unclear whether any potential damage to Mark's mental health could be repaired. I would recommend further trials of the project to get an understanding of possible problems that may arise and what kinds of psychological difficulties might be experienced so that these can be monitored carefully in the longer project."</p>

            <p>“Whatever the result of Seeing I, the documentary will be ground-breaking and give rise to a raft of new hypotheses and methodologies for social psychology to explore more systematically and in larger samples. I am reassured that Mark has taken sensible precautions in case there are side-effects, and one hopes if these occur that they are temporary and reversible. The ethical issues are important, and at a minimum the fact that the experimenter is also the consenting participant makes this more ethical.
